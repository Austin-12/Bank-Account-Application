BankAccountApp

The mission:

The purpose of this application is to read a CSV file and create both checkings and savings accounts. The
CSV file gives the first and last name, social security #, the type of account and a initial deposit. This project
allowed me to practice using implementing a interface, reading from a file and inheritance since checkings and savings
accounts have alot of similar functions. My biggest take aways from this project is learning how to property use access
modifiers I didn't know the use of the protected modifier until this project allowing child classes to access certain elements
while still being able to hide the data is very useful.

features:

Both types of accounts are allowed to deposit, withdraw, print balance/all information, transfer, and compound interest.
the savings accounts come with a safety deposit box and key. while the checking accounts come with a debit card and a pin
